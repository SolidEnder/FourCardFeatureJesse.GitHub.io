# FourCardFeatureJesse.GitHub.io
Second Front End Mentor project I've committed; Four Card Feature

Again, this was mostly a CSS and HTML project that focuses more on optimization. If there's anything to iron out, I'll be updating it. Here, I separated my CSS and HTML files 
unlike how I did with my first project, and as you can see, I have each card arranged vertically for the mobile view, and for the desktop view I have it arranged in a pattern
in the center of the screen. If you have feedback, suggestions or tips, let me know!
